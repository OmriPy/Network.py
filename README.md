# Network.py
The code I wrote during the course [network.py](https://courses.campus.gov.il/courses/course-v1:CS+GOV_CS_networkpy103+2020_1/course/).
## Details
The course focuses on implementing server - client protocols in python. It also explains the differences between TCP and UDP.
## Goal
The main goal of this course is to build a game of Trivia using TCP, and allowing the server to serve multiple clients at once.
